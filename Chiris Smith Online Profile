<h1>Christopher Smith</h1>
<h2>Online Profile of Christopher Smith</h2>
<P>I work with employed professionals 
    who do not have to make a move but would at least like the opportunity 
    to hear about what's out there in the event that their dream job surfaces. 
    I invest my time with people I feel have marketable skills and future potential, 
    learn what they do, where they are and where they want to take their career and
    try to get them there a little faster!</P>

    <p>Experienced in staffing, recruitment process outsourcing, and direct
        hire/headhunting.</p>
